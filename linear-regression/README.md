Simple regression i.e. linear regression and we will code a simple machine learning program to predict the relation b/w the head size and the brain weight of users. 
here - brain weight  grow then head size also going to be increase
so brain weight is independent variable and head size also going to be increase.
We have data of 237 users. The data is in the form of a .csv format that contains the following details about the users - 1. Gender, 2. Age range, 3. Brain Weight.
so figure out relationship b/w variables (dependent and independent) is by using graphs and images or plotting.
